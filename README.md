My website is designed to allow user free reign to search and score games. The site features a search function that scans one of the largest video game databases to return some results back. Users can quickly find games and find out lots of information realting to them. The site is made with the intention of making video game data acccessible quickly and efficiently

## Bugs

During development I encountered an issue where my workspace was not correctly building and would not save files correctly. To get around this I ended up creating a new Git repository based on the CI template. This seemed to fix my issue however a small amount of progress was lost and my README needed to be done from scratch
